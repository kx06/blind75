# Leetcode Blind75 Solutions

Written mostly in C and Python, this repo aims to compile all the solutions written by me for the Blind75 list by Neetcode.

Most of these solutions are optimal and satisfy the required Time and Space Complexities.

### ToDo

1. Adding comments in the solutions for better readability.
2. Writing an explanation comment below each solution for reference.
3. Writing Time and Space complexities of the solution and the optimal Time and Space complexity required by the question.
4. Adding Topics in the comments of the solution.
5. Solving the questions that haven't been solved yet :)
